                Consumer to company relations are great for everyone involved when done properly from the start, especially for a new franchise. Arguably just as important is maintaining that trust with future releases.

                Team Cherry, as a very small indy team working on their first game, knew this when making <em>Hollow Knight</em>. With a crowdfunding campaign and a new team with little experience or fame, Team Cherry created a satisfying experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the outset, “the side-scrolling action platformer was successful and critically celebrated, though it flew under the radar of some websites during a spring that featured the launch of a new Nintendo console and an overwhelming bounty of fantastic games.”<sup class="sourceLink">[1]</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                First impressions are important, so the fact that Team Cherry started with a complete game, only adding extra non-critical content as free dlc post-release gave an trustworthy impression. Players could trust this team to give them complete experiences, not half-baked ones.

                Once a series or developer has a loyal following, they can afford to spend and utilize that trust. This was true in the case of <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, the most recent entry in the widely successful <em>Smash Bros.</em> franchise.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this game had a lot of content at launch, several staples of the series such as the stage builder were missing at launch, only to be added back in later as free dlc.<sup class="sourceLink">[2]</sup> However, since <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> had already gained the loyalty and trust of consumers, players didn't mind. Even without these missing features, Famitsu gave <em>Super Smash Brothers Ultimate</em> their game of the year award.<sup class="sourceLink">[3]</sup>
